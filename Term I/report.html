		<h2>Report</h2>

		<p>Being a computer enthusiast, I always dreamed of being able to create a program or website of my own. 
			By enrolling in Bsc.Computing program I was able to learn the basics of HTML and CSS and was able to build a responsive website. 
			I had all of the basic information and syntaxes of various features that help us successfully build a responsive website. 
			I would like to thank my tutor, Mr. Ankit Thapa, for providing me proper guidance and his unique teaching style helped me build this project with minimum errors.</p>
			
		<p>My experience working on this project has been adventurous. The highs and lows made it more interesting.
			 Despite the fact that it was difficult to identify the errors, I had a great time fabricating this website. 
			 Encountering errors now and then undoubtedly was punishing but it surely made me more conscious about the way of writing not only correct but also well-styled code. 
			 Over the course of developing this website, I learned how to approach different problems/errors and solve them. </p>

				<img src="Images/homeB4.png" alt="Homepage before" class="full">
				<img src="Images/homeAF.png" alt="Homepage after" class="full">
			</div>
				<p>Home page: My initial home page had an old scroll bar with lied under my introduction, this paticular design
					wasn't as good as i expected it to be so later i decided to change and keep it as simple as possible.
				</p>

			<div class="report-grid">
				<img src="Images/portB4m.png" alt="portfolio before" class="port">
				<img src="Images/portfolioAFm.png" alt="portfolio after" class="port">
			</div>
				<p>Portfolio page: The portfolio page was made using girid type display with two columns. The layout wasn't responsive
					so to make it responsive I changed the display type grid from two columns to only one column. </p>		
				
			<div class="report-grid">
				<img src="Images/cvB4m.png" alt="CV before" class="cv">
				<img src="Images/cvAFm.png" alt="CV after" class="cv">
			</div>
				<p>CV page: The cv page for responsive page wasn't aligned properly due to 2 grid coulmn. Even after using only one column the tabe was 
					too big for the screen. I decided to use x-overflow so the table can fit inside screen and can be slided on either direction
					to view the data. </p>
