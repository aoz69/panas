		<h2>Report</h2>

		<p>Being a computer enthusiast, I always dreamed of being able to create a program or website of my own. 
			By enrolling in Bsc.Computing program I was able to learn the basics of HTML and CSS and was able to build a responsive website. 
			The term I had all of the basic information and syntaxes of various features which help us successfully build a responsive website. 
			I would like to thank my tutor, Mr. Ankit Thapa, for providing me proper guidance and his unique teaching style helped me build this project with minimum errors.</p>
			
			<p>My experience working on this project has been adventurous. The ups and downs made it more interesting. 
				Although it was hard to identify the errors I had a great time building this website. 
				Experiencing errors now and then sure was punishing but it surely made me more conscious about the way of writing a good code. 
				Googling various ways of doing certain things was exciting. </p>
